# Motorbikes 2021

This repository is for this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/morebikes2021/overview) for __'Roussel'__ and __'Subin'__. The goal is predict the number of bicycles at rental stations 3 hours in advance. We have written three notebooks that deal with seperate aspects of the asignment.

### [MotorBikes - Analysis & Per-Station Training](https://www.kaggle.com/desmondrn/motorbikes-analysis-per-station-training)
The goal of this notebook is to analyse the dataset and identify the best features and best per-station machine learning algorithms to use in the next phases of the competition. Here is the Kaggle link.

### [MotorBikes - All-Stations Training & Comparison](https://www.kaggle.com/desmondrn/motorbikes-all-stations-training-comparison)
This next notebook deals with Phase 1 of the Kaggle competition. First, we build 75 different models for each station (a), then we build one model for all stations at once (b). After that, we compare these two approaches and discus some variables that affect the learning process in both cases.

### [MotorBikes - Peter's Models & Comparison](https://www.kaggle.com/desmondrn/motorbikes-peter-s-models-comparison)
This last notebook deals with Phases 2 and 3 of the Kaggle competition. It build on the results from the previous notebook to compare our models with the 200 pre-trained linear models that were provided. After that, we combined those models' predictions with ours from Phase 1 hence reusing the knowledge learned from a whole year's data, and knowledge from appropriate stations.
